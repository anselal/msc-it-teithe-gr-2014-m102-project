Before you start your application
---------------------------------

After you succefully uploaded the application to your server, rename the .htaccess_server file to .htaccess
It is very possible that a file with the same name already exists on your server, so keep a backup of your
original file before you replace it. 
The .htaccess file will remove the /index.php/ from the url so it be more userfriendly and searchengine-friendly.
The code is optimized to not use the index.php file at all. This mean that if you do not make use of our .htaccess
file, the application will not work correctly or at all.
